# Invoice-Analysis-NB
## Summary
I was contacted in July by an oil company to collect and analyze data regarding drivers overreporting 
hours, which in turn was allegedly causing the company to overbill some customers. Over the course of 
12 weeks I performed manual data entry, web scraping GPS data with Selenium, and data analysis in 
Python. I determined that there was, in fact, a problem with drivers overreporting their hours that 
culminated in April with over half of the 1000+ tickets being flagged. I was able to provide a 
spreadsheet showing the drivers/trucks that offended the most often and most severely. Finally, 
I was able to show that the action taken by the company in May was effective in reducing both the 
frequency and severity of such tickets. This information was presented directly to the CEO and upper 
management, and it was determined that no further action was necessary at the time, but that they would 
be updating systems to keep better track of such things should a problem arise.
